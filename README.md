Be aware this project is more of a fun thing than an actual try at creating a usable -   
Game Engine

### Documentation
Well, currently there is none, I'll write some in the future but for now the [Test.py](Tests/Test.py) has -    
to be the docs.

Also, currently there is only the core of the Engine no editor for it, meaning you can -    
easily create game like stuff, but you need to write the code completely yourself
